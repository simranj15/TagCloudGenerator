# Tag Cloud Generator (Java)

## Overview
A Java-based text analysis program that generates a tag cloud representation from an input text source.
The application processes text by identifying words, counting their occurrences, and ranking them by frequency to determine prominence in the final output. 
The project focuses on string parsing, data structures, and algorithmic design.

## Features
- Tokenizes input text using customizable separators
- Counts word frequencies using map-based data structures
- Sorts words by frequency to determine tag prominence
- Generates formatted tag cloud output
- Handles input validation and edge cases (punctuation, spacing, case sensitivity)
- Modular design separating parsing, counting, and sorting logic

## Built With
- **Java**
- Maps for frequency analysis
- Sorting algorithms for ranking words
- Modular object-oriented design

## Process
1. Reads and processes an input text file
2. Separates words using defined delimiters
3. Counts the frequency of each unique word
4. Sorts words based on occurrence count
5. Outputs a structured tag cloud representation

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment focused on text processing and data structure implementation. The code demonstrates practical use of maps, sorting logic, and modular program design while reinforcing algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Learning Outcomes
- Text parsing and tokenization
- Frequency analysis using maps
- Sorting and ranking data
- Writing modular, maintainable Java code
- Translating problem requirements into structured implementations
